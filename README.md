## Contents of this Repo
* In the [Documentation](documentation) folder you find detailed explanations of our data models, as well as the business rules that have to be observed when constructing a timetable.

* The [utils](utils) folder contains some utilities such as
    - a script to translate the problem instances into English and solutions back into German
