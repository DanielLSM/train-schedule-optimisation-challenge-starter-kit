# Available Documentation
In this folder you should find all necessary background information to complete your task of producing a timetable to our problem instances.

What's available?:

* Before reading anything more detailed, we recommend to look at the [Very Quick Introduction](#a-very-quick-introduction-to-our-timetabling-problem) below. It gives a very brief, but surprisingly complete, description of what the problem is all about. <br>All the rest is basically just technicalities to make the data model and the rules precise.

* In [a worked example](documentation/a_worked_example.md) we solve a simple [sample problem instance](sample_files/sample_scenario.json) "on paper" from the ground up. <br>
This may also be helpful to work through before diving into the data model definitions below.

* The [input data model](documentation/input_data_model.md) describes the data model of the problem instances in detail.
* The [output data model](documentation/output_data_model.md) describes the data model in which the grader expects the solutions to the problem instances.

* The [business rules](documentation/business_rules.md) define the precise set of rules that have to be observed when producing a solution to a problem instance. It also describes how a solution is scored by the grader.
